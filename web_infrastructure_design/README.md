# Web Stack & System Design Project

## Overview

In this project, you will learn about and create a basic web stack, including various components such as servers, databases, load balancers, and monitoring systems. You will be required to demonstrate your knowledge through diagrams and explanations of each component's role within a system. The project also emphasizes redundancy, system design, and best practices for deployment and high availability.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- **Diagram the web stack** you've built with the sysadmin/devops track projects.
- **Explain** what each component is doing.
- **Explain system redundancy** and how to avoid downtime during deployments.
- Understand the key acronyms: **LAMP**, **SPOF**, and **QPS**.

## Resources

Before you begin, make sure to read or watch the following:

- Network basics concept page
- Server concept page
- Web server concept page
- DNS concept page
- Load balancer concept page
- Monitoring concept page
- What is a database
- What’s the difference between a web server and an app server?
- DNS record types
- Single point of failure (SPOF)
- How to avoid downtime when deploying new code
- High availability cluster (active-active/active-passive)
- What is HTTPS
- What is a firewall

## Requirements

### General

- You must create a **README.md** file at the root of your project folder.
- For each task, once you are done drawing a diagram, take a picture or screenshot of your diagram.
- This project will be **manually reviewed**.
  - As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green.
  - Upload the screenshot to an image hosting service (e.g., Imgur), and insert the link to the screenshot into your answer file.
  - After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box.
- You will also need to **whiteboard** each task in front of a mentor, staff, or student.
  - No computers or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session.

### Focus

- **Keep your focus on the requirements** mentioned in this project. You will have **30 minutes** to complete each task during the whiteboarding session.
- **Be concise and to the point** in your answers. If the interviewer doesn't ask for details, don't offer them. If you're unsure whether to elaborate, always ask the interviewer if more detail is necessary.
  
### Task Breakdown

For each task, you should:

1. **Draw a diagram** on paper, software, or a whiteboard that outlines the web stack you’ve built in your sysadmin/devops projects.
2. **Take a picture or screenshot** of your diagram.
3. **Upload it to an image hosting service** (e.g., Imgur).
4. **Insert the image URL into your answer file**.
5. Complete each task based on the requirements and move on to the next task once completed.

## Web Stack Components

Your diagram should include, but not be limited to, the following components:

1. **Network Basics** - Diagram showing networking components like routers, switches, and devices.
2. **Server** - Explanation of how servers handle requests, processing data, and their role in the stack.
3. **Web Server** - Explanation of how a web server serves static content to clients over HTTP.
4. **DNS** - How DNS maps domain names to IP addresses, ensuring the right site is served.
5. **Load Balancer** - A diagram showing load balancing between multiple servers.
6. **Monitoring** - How monitoring tools track server performance, uptime, and errors.
7. **Database** - Database systems (SQL/NoSQL), storage, and retrieval of data.
8. **Web Server vs. App Server** - Understanding their differences.
9. **DNS Record Types** - A summary of different DNS record types like A, CNAME, MX.
10. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)** - Identify and design systems to eliminate SPOF.
11. **Avoiding Downtime** - Deployment strategies (e.g., blue-green deployment, canary releases).
12. **High Availability Cluster** - Understanding active-active vs. active-passive clusters.
13. **HTTPS** - The importance of encryption in HTTPS.
14. **Firewall** - Security mechanisms to control incoming and outgoing traffic.

## Acronyms

- **LAMP**: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
- **SPOF**: Single Point of Failure
- **QPS**: Queries Per Second

## Conclusion

This project will help you understand the core components of system architecture, including web servers, databases, load balancing, monitoring, and security. Your ability to create diagrams, explain system redundancy, and understand web stack components will be key to your success.
